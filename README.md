# Typeform Discord Init (Design)
Very simple Discord Bot that will automatically post a Typeform response to a Discord Channel.


This is useful for moderation of a Discord server. Consider the story of a team that sets up a small discord server. This team decides
to choose Typeform.com as its' platform for creating interactive forms. The moderation team decides to use typeform for volunteer staff applications, ban appeals, complaints about the server, members or staff in that community.


The server moderator who elects themselves in charge of managing the server's typeform account would have the sole access to
these forms, may need to log themselves into [TypeForm](typeform.com), open the responses, copy and paste them (unformatted plain text) into Discord
for the whole moderation team to see it.


This bot intends to rid that annoying manual work by automatically posting each submitted response to a typeform directly into a Discord
channelÂ the moment that submission happens. And if for whatever reason it were missed the first time, this bot should be responsive to
basic commands in Discord allowing it to read the responses waiting on any typeform on the account.


That is the goal of this project.

## But How?

With a typeform account, we have access to APIs off developer.typeform.com free of charge. I've looked at the documentation, and it has become apparent that we will use:

https://developer.typeform.com/webhooks/

for when the responses are initially made. We can configure events that would fire as a response is submitted. And then:

https://developer.typeform.com/responses/

This api will allow us to call and read responses on a typeform, which would be perfect for user commands entered on Discord with a
prefix `!` like `!marco` (as demonstrated in code on early commits)



(PS, I'm a professional Typescript developer, as well as developer that works with RX Forms. If I make a typo about Typeform, it was
probably inevitable)

## Current Progress

This first commit to this repository has a file called `test-bot.js`. [With NPM Installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), run `node test-bot.js` to start up the bot. If this bot were configured with your server correctly, this script should bring that bot online in your server. Then, in any channel that the bot user is given access to, you can call `!marco`. It should then respond with "Polo!"


This demonstrates creating a node js bot. The source code here will be changed to include more functionality to the bot instance, such as responding to a typeform webhook by posting in a discord channel, and also responding to user commands by reading Typeform information.
