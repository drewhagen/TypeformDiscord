# TypeformDiscord
Very simple Discord Bot that will automatically post a Typeform response to a Discord Channel.

This is useful for moderation of a Discord server. Consider the story of a team that sets up a small discord server. This team decides
to choose Typeform.com as its' platform for creating interactive forms. The moderation team decides to use typeform for volunteer staff applications, ban appeals, complaints about the server, members or staff in that community.

The server moderator who elects themselves in charge of managing the server's typeform account would have the sole access to
these forms, may need to log themselves into typeform.com, open the responses, copy and paste them (unformatted plain text) into Discord
for the whole moderation team to see it.

This bot intends to rid that annoying manual work by automatically posting each submitted response to a typeform directly into a Discord
channelÂ the moment that submission happens. And if for whatever reason it were missed the first time, this bot should be responsive to
basic commands in Discord allowing it to read the responses waiting on any typeform on the account.

That is the goal of this project.
